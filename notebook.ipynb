What is unique about a notebook is that it's **interactive**: You can change or add code cells and then **run** a cell by selecting it and then clicking the **Run** button on the right ( <strong>▶</strong>, or Run All ) or hitting `control + enter`.\n\nThe result will be displayed directly in the notebook.
